Web-based collaborative text editor that allows multiple users to edit a document simultaneously in real-time. This application will enable users to collaborate on text documents, see each other's cursors, and observe real-time updates made by other collaborators. 
Features:

1. Real-time Collaboration: Multiple users should be able to edit the same document concurrently, with changes being reflected in real-time for all collaborators.
2. Cursor Synchronization: Each user's cursor should be visible to all other collaborators, allowing them to see where others are editing within the document.
3. Text Highlighting: Collaborators should be able to highlight specific portions of the text, and these highlights should be visible to all participants.
4. User Presence Indicators: The application should display indicators showing which users are currently editing the document.
